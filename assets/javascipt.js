    //A function that chooses a random quesiton from an array

    //A funciton that is a count down timer(75 secs) When the timer equals zero the game ends
        //there will also be a penality for getting questions wrong (15 secs)
        //Maybe we can add a addtional amount of time for questions rights, however keep in mind, that if we add time there needs to be enough questions so that getting extra time is worth it. 
        //Another thing we could do is give extra points dependent how quick the answer is submitted. 
    
    //A function that keeps track of current score

    //A function that store the data to the browser (basically stores high scores but maybe we can also store answers to questions too.)
    
    //A function to grab the users intials when the game ends
